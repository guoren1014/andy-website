      <p>This is a novel on-going project. This design is to use embodiment-interaction approach to better teach children to conceptualize zero. A symmetry concept between positive and negative number introduced in this project. The first stage of the project is created in a Java-based platform. </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">What I brought to the table:</p>
      <p>Cognitive-sciences Embodied/Enactive approach, Java Programming Skills, Design-Based Learning</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">What I learned</p>
      <p>While analyzing my device throughout my design and development stages, I discovered that students of different grades focused on different elements. For example, preschool kids are more concerned about the real objects, and higher level students focus more on the number itself and inner problem-solving analysis. I began to pay close attention to the cognitive factors that influenced the different levels of learning for various demographic backgrounds. It became clear to me that the way children learn new things is actually very different from how the current educator learned and the ways in which they were cultivated. The fact that children notice symmetry among the zero, and related positive and negative numbers means that they have at least a qualitative assertion of what this means. As a researcher, I am using this rudimentary notion as a means of supporting their understanding of the learning objective (positive vs. negative numbers). Also, we need to engage students to build and use their hands in order to interact with the learning materials instead of the traditional class lecture approach.  </p>

      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">What I learned?</p>
      <p>Designed “The Beauty of English Language” (TBEL)
      Instructional Projects by analyzing learners’

      Integrate the origin of English language and 
      increase learners’ interest and passion in language 
      learning.
      Activate the learning attitudes and
